<p>The Moon, Earth's natural satellite, has captivated humanity for millennia with its luminous presence in the night sky. Its serene beauty belies a tumultuous history, believed to have formed over 4.5 billion years ago from debris ejected during a colossal collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body. This cataclysmic event not only birthed the Moon but also shaped its compositionâ€”primarily silicate rock with vast plains of ancient volcanic basalt, known as lunar maria, and rugged highlands scarred by countless impact craters. The Moon's lack of atmosphere and geological activity has preserved these features virtually unchanged over eons, offering a pristine record of early Solar System history. From the Apollo landings that saw humans tread upon its dusty surface to ongoing robotic missions and future plans for lunar exploration, the Moon continues to beckon exploration and inspire scientific inquiry, providing insights into planetary formation, the evolution of celestial bodies, and potential future endeavors beyond Earth's confines.
