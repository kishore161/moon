<p>Deimos, one of Mars' two moons, orbits the Red Planet at a distance of about 23,460 kilometers, making it the smaller and outermost of the Martian moons. Discovered by Asaph Hall in 1877, Deimos is irregularly shaped and relatively tiny, with a mean radius of approximately 6.2 kilometers. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling many asteroids in the outer asteroid belt, leading scientists to believe it may be a captured asteroid itself. Deimos lacks significant geological activity, contrasting sharply with its sibling moon Phobos. Despite its small size and remote location from Mars, Deimos holds scientific interest due to its likely origins and the potential insights it could provide into the history of Mars and the outer Solar System. As of now, no spacecraft have landed on or directly explored Deimos, leaving much of its mysteries to future exploration missions.
