<p>Callisto, one of Jupiter's largest moons, stands out as a testament to the Solar System's ancient history. It orbits the gas giant at a distance of approximately 1.88 million kilometers, making it the outermost of the Galilean moons. Discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610, Callisto is notable for its heavily cratered surface, suggesting a lack of significant geological activity over billions of years. Its diameter of about 4,821 kilometers makes it larger than the planet Mercury, yet its composition is predominantly icy and rocky. Callisto's landscape is marked by impact craters of various sizes, including multi-ring structures that hint at powerful impacts in its distant past. It possesses a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, though it is too thin to support life as we know it. Callisto's remote and frigid environment makes it a compelling subject for further exploration, offering clues to the early formation and evolution of Jupiter's extensive moon system and the broader dynamics of the outer Solar System.
